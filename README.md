# YODO 
This is a one button app. It has an appealing button that displays a new famous quote and its author. 
Those quotes are stored in a tableView and persisted with CoreData. If you click over a row the app transitions to another view where you can transform the quote into Yodaâ€™s words (to sound more profound). It works to find inspiration, usually when you find yourself talking in the same voice as Yoda does.
